Example of Parallel programming
===================
Paralle computing uses multiple computing resources at once to accelerate computation. Although this technique is powerful, many collages feel hard to apply the methods on their work. So I decide to share my tips to start parallel programming. 

This repository provides the basic examples of parallel programming in c++ and python for statistical physics community. Each example folders contain simple problem that is easily parallelize.
